Olivier, during the meeting, provided key questions and expectations for the analysis.

## B.Steps:


   ### 1.Reformulating Requirements:

    <li>Prepare technical documentation, including:
       <li>Updated schema image.
       <li>Updated dictionary image.
       <li> Image of the database management system showing constructed tables.
       <li> A separate document containing a list of queries and their results in PDF format.
