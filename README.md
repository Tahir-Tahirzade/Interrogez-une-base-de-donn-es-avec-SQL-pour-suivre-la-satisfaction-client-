## A. Project Overview:

#### I have recently joined BestMarket, a major retail company, as a Business Intelligence Analyst. The company aims to leverage customer feedback data to enhance the quality of its store network.A few days into my role, I participated in a project kick-off meeting led by Mélanie, the lead data analyst, in the presence of Olivier, the customer service manager.My mission is to analyze customer feedback data and provide insights to improve the overall store experience. Olivier, during the meeting, provided key questions and expectations for the analysis.

## B.Steps:


  ### 1.Reformulating Requirements:
